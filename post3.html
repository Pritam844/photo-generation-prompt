    <h1>POST 3 – AI PHOTO PROMPT</h1>

    <div class="prompt-box" id="promptText">
A man wearing a black winter puffer jacket and a grey hoodie is taking a selfie on a frozen lake. The hair should be exactly the same as the original reference — the same length, texture, and style (not long). The face and hair from the first added photo should be preserved without any distortion. His face is partially obscured by the raised collar of his jacket, which he is holding with his left hand, and dark sunglasses. On the left side of the frame, in the background, a black Mercedes-Benz CLS 63 AMG (W219) is parked on the snow. The vehicle is naturally covered in snow and frost. There is no license plate. The car is positioned facing away from the camera, and tire tracks are visible on the ice. The background is a wide, snow-covered lake stretching to the horizon; a dark strip of forest and a few small structures are visible in the distance. The sky is completely covered with dense grey clouds; it is beginning to darken (twilight after sunset). The camera is positioned at eye level, taken from a close distance; The details of the clothing and abdominal texture are clearly visible.

There is a slight motion blur and softness that gives the impression of being shot with a smartphone. Photorealistic, cool

tones and natural lighting.
