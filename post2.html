    <h1>POST 2 – AI PHOTO PROMPT</h1>

    <div class="prompt-box" id="promptText">
SELFIE PHOTO, a selfie taken with one hand. Use the attached PERSON photo as an identification reference: face

and resemblance must be exactly the same, no changes should be made to the face. The person is taking the selfie with ONE HAND: right

arm fully extended, camera/phone held just outside the frame; slight shoulder raise and

natural wrist angle, slight body rotation typical of one-handed selfies. The other hand is relaxed and EMPTY, holding nothing. Phone/camera is not visible. Composition: close-up head and shoulders frame, 9:16 vertical

format, everyone tightly grouped around the person. Slight wide-angle

perspective distortion typical of one-handed selfie lenses. The setting feels like a warm and

clunky bedroom/studio with vintage decor, as in the attached ROOM reference; however, the shot was taken during the day with NATURAL window light coming from one side. Balanced exposure, soft shadows, and clean, natural colors.

Camera: Super ultra-wide selfie lens view (arm fully extended), natural skin texture, faces are clear,

realistic depth of field (background not overly blurred). All characters are present, realistic, high-level

rendered in 3D with real materials and physically based lighting (not flat cartoon):

Woody: Leaning forward over his left shoulder, hat visible, friendly expression. Buzz Lightyear: Leaning over his right shoulder, helmet open, confident smile. Rex: In the background, peeking his head between Woody and Buzz, playful grin. Mr. Potato Head: In the lower left, slightly closer to the camera, funny expression. Slinky Dog: Circling the group from the lower right, head visible and smiling, body curving. Lotso: Slightly behind and higher up the group, plush bear texture clearly visible, warm but slightly mischievous smile. Everyone is positioned around the person's shoulders and

behind them; no one is covering the person's face, all eyes are looking at the lens. Ultra-realistic

details: accurate fabric weave details, specular reflections on plastic surfaces, plush fur fibers,

slight subsurface scattering effect on the skin, natural and grounded shadows in the space.
